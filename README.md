# Notes-CSS-Secrets
Notes and code example from the book CSS Secrets by Lea Vebou

## Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- The opposite of DRY is WET. (We love typing, Write everything twice)
- The first tip is **use em/%/rem** wherever you can because these value will scale accordingly to the parents. It will reduce alot of modification of codes when you want to change the size of a button
- The 2nd tip is for colors. **Use black and set opacity** to control the light/brightness of a color if you want to have a few variation of the same color on a object.
